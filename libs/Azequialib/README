./test:  Source code for the examples
./doc:   Some documentation (probably out of date)
./inet:  Source code for network levels


Installing Azequia.
-------------------

1. Download and decompress Azequia.


2. Set up installation options in root folder Makefile.

OPTION 1. Set installation folder. 

AZQ_INSTALL_DIR


OPTION 2. Network. Current support options are:

  - TCPIP:  shared memory for communication in the same machine and TCP/IP for remote communication.
  - NONE:   only shared memory.

Set the NET_TYPE option with the correct value.


OPTION 3. Platform. 

If you are going to run Azequia in a system with POSIX 1003.1c support (e.g. Linux), you can choose LINUX or MACOSX. MACOSX only provides limited support for some features like semaphores or timers.
You can choose OSI, an implementation of the POSIX 1003.1c standard for Digital Signal Processing systems of Texas Instruments on top of DSP/BIOS operating system. If do, set the root folder for OSI installation.
OSI can be downloaded from http://gim.unex.es/osi

Set AZQ_PLATFORM_OPTS with correct values.


OPTION 4. Debug support.

Different levels of debugging messages showed.

Set AZQ_DEBUG_OPTS with correct values.


OPTION 5. C compiler options

set AZQ_COMPILING_OPTS with correct values for passing to C compiler.


OPTION 6. Other options:

AZQ_MPI: This options needs to be used for supporting AzequiaMPI library, an implementation of MPI-1 on top of Azequia. AzequiaMPI can be downloaded from:
http://gim.unex.es/azequiampi

__XPN_PRINT: This option enables the exception verbose mode of Azequia.

set AZQ_OTHER_OPTS with correct values.


3. Compiling Azequia. Type:

make clean; make; make install


4. If you want to compile tests:

make tests


Using Azequia.
--------------

Goto to tests/basic folder and type:

make clean; make 

for compiling example.

You need the MPD daemon for running applications

The executable needs to be available to all the nodes (e.g. through NFS). Launch mpd daemon on the nodes and type:

mpiexec -n 4 ./executable

(Note that -n option indicates the number of nodes, not the number of endpoints as usually used in MPI implementations).
